input=length n
looping through all the numbers= O(n)
Going through the list twice in the range 1..n
outer loop is at range 2..n+1
n = 2..n+1
for i, which is every integer n
do anoher inner loop at a range 2..i
inner loop takes m iterations
so total iterations=m*n
but m==n
hence n^2
for worst case scenario O(n^2)
